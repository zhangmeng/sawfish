StyleTab

Tab themes for sawfish. This theme combines flexibility, appealing
look'n'feel and innovative ideas. As of Sawfish 1.8.0 it's the default theme.

It combines 4 themes (Reduce, Dark, Silver & Smoothly), bundled
with support for tabbed windowing. StyleTab provides various options like for
titlebar colors or button-order (separately for toplevel windows and transients),
aswell as support for having the titlebar on any of the four sides (can be
different for each window, using the "title-position" window-matcher, or
temporary by  clicking on the icon in the titlebar).

Ideas/code taken over from Crux/Anonymous/Mxflat/Reduce themes.
