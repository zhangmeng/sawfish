;; Commentary:

;; Sawfish's workspace are organised as a 1-dimensional continuum, from
;; -infinity to +infinity. Normally the user only sees a small part of
;; this continuum, from the first non-empty workspace to the last
;; non-empty workspace

;; So that we never run out of workspace ids the non-empty portion is
;; intermittently normalised to start with index zero

;; Inserting and deleting workspaces just involves shuffling the
;; workspace index of each window

;; The intention is that whatever structure the user wants to see (e.g.
;; grid, cube, ...) is built on top of the underlying 1d structure

;; Each window can be a member of any (positive) number of workspaces;
;; the `workspaces' property contains a list of workspace ids. Sticky
;; windows appear on all workspaces, and have their `sticky' property
;; set (with a null `workspaces' property)

;; When a window appears on more than one workspaces most of it's
;; properties are swapped in and out on demand when the current
;; workspace is changed. Use the `workspace-local-properties' and the
;; `workspace-swap-{in,out}-hook' variables (see workspace-swapper module)

;; If a window is added with its `workspaces' property set, then it's
;; added to those (logical) spaces

;; Private functions are prefixed by ws-
