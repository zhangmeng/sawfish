known bugs/limitations
----------------------

-maximized window is too small/big if the maximized/unmaximized border size
  are not equal or if you've set bigger corners (this is hard to correct since
  themes only have restriced access to sawfish's window functions)
  (update: i dont know if mmc's patch has already reached the sf cvs, let me know if it should
  work someday)
  
-when resizing the button icons you have to restart sawfish for this to take effect
  (this is also necessary for the button icon set)
  besides quality is very poor (thats because the images are so small, there's not much
  one could do about it)

-the fake shadow can bearly be called so, improve it:
  eg the fake shadow's position is wrong if border-offset != 0
  and the window is shaded

-many gradient things have to be improved:
  eg when the gradient titlebar background is activated and the window is
  too small for the gradient sawfish reports an error on console
  (i think this is because the gradient function tries to fill a 0x0 pixel image)

-with gnome2/sawfish-1.2 the options in sawfish-config change on the fly but that is
  sometimes really slow, improve speed

-due to the newer update behaviour we have some problems with sawfish >=1.0


some things i can imagine to/will implement if they are possible
----------------------------------------------------------------

-rounded window frames like the rounded edges of gtk-flat-engine buttons
  (either through recolorable half-transparent images or alltogether with lisp functions)

-completely customizable buttons, ie one has a list and an add button and an
  add dialog for each button with adjustable colors, icons, zoom, size, command-key bindings etc
  (note: this is, at least as far as i know, not possible right now since sawfish is missing
  a defcustom table type with freely configurable add dialogs and one cannot create custom types
  in a theme because this is restriced to sawfish modules)
