These scripts are intended to automatically take screenshots of sawfish themes.

To install/configure, do the following:

  - Install dependencies:

    # apt-get install cowsay xnest imagemagick xterm
    # apt-get install feh
    # apt-get install ... (more?)

  - Add a test user to your system.

    # adduser sawfish

  - Set up your sawfish directory.

    % su sawfish
    % cd
    % mkdir .sawfish
    % cd .sawfish
    % mkdir tarballs themes
    % cp /path/to/theme/tarballs/*.tar.gz ~/.sawfish/tarballs

  - Put these scripts in your path.

    % mkdir ~/bin
    % echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
    % cp /path/to/these/sawfish/scripts/* ~/bin

Then, you should be able to actually run the scripts.

  % mkdir ~/screenshots
  % cd ~/screenshots
  % make_screenshots.sh
