BUGS
****

If you think you have found a bug,

1. Check if it'll be a new report.
First check for newer versions of sawfish and librep/rep-gtk.  If it
still happens with the latest versions, search for similar bugs by web
searching / in GNOME Bugzilla (http://bugzilla.gnome.org).

All open bugs in Bugzilla are found at:
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&product=Sawfish&order=Bug+Number

For search from a browser (like firefox "smart keyword"), use this URL:
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&product=Sawfish&order=Bug+Number&content=%s

If it already has been reported, simply reply to the existing report,
rather than opening a new one.

2. Ok, it's a new bug.
Please report it to our Mailing list
(http://sawfish.wikia.com/wiki/Mailing_list). It will be viewed by
much more people than to report it in Bugzilla. Bugzilla submission
howto is explained later.

When reporting bugs try to include as much relevant information as
possible:

 - Most importantly: a reliable method for triggering the bug.

 - If you hear beeping sounds while the problem manifests itself it may
   mean that sawfish's Lisp interpreter is printing error messages to
   the standard error stream (often stored in ~/.xsession-errors or
   ~/.gnomerc-errors). Include any such messages in your bug report.

 - If sawfish crashes it will try to print information describing the
   position at which it did so. Please start Sawfish again with the
   command line option "--interp"; it'll take a little bit to start,
   but more information is printed at crash. Look for any "backtrace"
   messages in the error output and include them.

 - The operating system type and version (including distribution details)

 - How you installed sawfish, e.g. compiled from source, from binary
   packages, etc.. If from packages, where did you get the packages
   from, and what are their version numbers?

 - Any other information you feel may be relevant. E.g. the values of
   customization options that you feel may affect the problem.

Also please make sure to not report bugs multiple times, first check if
there's already a report for your issue.

To report a bug to the Bugzilla
-------------------------------
Go to https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi

As product choose: Other -> Sawfish

Then choose the version you're using, for example, pre-1.3.x (obsolete),
1.5.x, and so on.

At last choose the sawfish component you want to report the bug for:
	- config tool
	- general
	- window-manager
	- theme editor (This item is obsolete)
