;; Commentary:

;; Provides a virtual desktop "grid" abstraction, using workspaces. In
;; effect, this emulates viewports with workspaces

;; Gets desktop layout information from the _NET_DESKTOP_LAYOUT root
;; property according to a proposed ICWWM EWMH spec.  Accounts for bugs
;; in gnome2's implementation.

;;; Public Procedures

  ;; The workspace-switcher makes a desktop grid by splitting a sequence of
  ;; workspaces into rows and columns.
  ;;
  ;; With a horizontal panel, workspaces line up as
  ;;    1 2 3
  ;;    4 5 6
  ;; but with a vertical panel, they line up as
  ;;    1 4
  ;;    2 5
  ;;    3 6
  ;;
  ;; I take the convention that a "row" is a sequence of consecutive
  ;; workspaces (horizontal for a horizontal panel, vertical for a vertical
  ;; panel), and a "column" is the opposite (vertical on a horizontal panel,
  ;; horizontal on a vertical panel).  This way, I can just think about what
  ;; the coordinate code is supposed to do on horizontal panels, and then
  ;; translate it to "up", "down", "left", "right", etc. later.
  ;;
  ;; A `coordinates' object consists of the pair (column . row).
